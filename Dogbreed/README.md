In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.  ![Sample Output][image1]Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, you will make important design decisions about the user experience for the app.  The  goal is that by completing this lab, one will  understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline.  Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer.  Even an imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!##  InstructionsJupiter notebook file: dog_app-Copy2.ipynb.json it is now in the upper folder.Report file: dogbreed.htmlOther files: extract_bottleneck_features.pyBottleneck files and image files are not provided in this Github due to large file sizes.Recommended to download the files to see them due to file sizes.
